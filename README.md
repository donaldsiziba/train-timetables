Train Timetables
================

This is an example taken from chapter 2 of John Ferguson Smart's [BDD in Action](https://www.manning.com/books/bdd-in-action) book. This
particular example has been changed to depict the South African Gautrain Service, which
services the Gauteng Metropolitan area.

I have done additional work to expose the original services through a REST API.

More documentation to follow.
